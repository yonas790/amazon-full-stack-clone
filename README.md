This is a brief description of my Amazon project. It is an e-commerce application that allows users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and make secure purchases.

### Progress
I have made significant progress while working on this project, focusing on creating a user-friendly experience and ensuring the application is secure and reliable.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: 
  - **React**: For building dynamic user interfaces.
  - **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
  - **CSS**: For styling the application.
  - **Bootstrap**: To ensure responsiveness and a modern design.
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: For server-side logic and handling requests.
  - **Express**: To create a robust API for the application.
- **Database**:
  - **MySQL**: For managing user data, product information, and transactions.
- **Others**:
  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
  - **Firebase**: For real-time database functionality and user authentication.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Implemented secure user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt for password hashing. This ensures that user accounts are protected and only authorized users can access certain features.

- **Product Management**: Developed a comprehensive product management system that allows admins to add, edit, and delete products from the database. Each product includes essential details like name, description, price, and stock availability.

- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Created a dynamic shopping cart that enables users to add or remove products, update quantities, and view the total cost of their selected items. The cart persists even when users navigate away from the page.

- **Payment System**: Integrated a secure payment gateway using stripe. This feature allows users to make purchases seamlessly and ensures that sensitive payment information is handled securely.

- **Order Management**: Implemented an order management system that allows users to view their order history, track the status of their orders, and receive notifications for order updates.




### Backend Deployment
The backend is deployed on another hosting website, ensuring seamless performance and reliability. This setup allows for efficient handling of user requests and data management.

### Conclusion
This Amazon project showcases my skills in full-stack development and my ability to create robust applications. I am continuously looking to improve and expand upon the features in this project.
